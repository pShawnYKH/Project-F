# Project-F
This project was created to apply our knowledge in Java programming and showcase how it can be used in developing games. It showcases our skills in designing a classic pixel core top-down 2D RPG Systems and building an interactive environment using LibGDX framework to hasten the development.

It features:
- Core top-down 2D RPG systems
- Interactive environment
- Designed using the **LibGDX** framework for faster development

## Planned Features (In Progress)
- Procedural randomized dirt tile sprites
- Custom Tiled map integration  
- Smooth camera and movement system  
- Player animation system (in development)  
- Interactable entities (trees, shrubs, buildings)  
- Collision and terrain layering
